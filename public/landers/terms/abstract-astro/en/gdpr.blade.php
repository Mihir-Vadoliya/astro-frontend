If you are a resident of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), you have certain data protection rights and we will endeavour to take reasonable steps to enable you to correct, amend, delete or limit the use of your Personal Information. If you would like to know what Personal Information we hold about you and if you would like it removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:
<br><br>
(i) You have the right to withdraw your consent where you have previously consented to the processing of your Personal Data. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal Data is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. The withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the withdrawal.
<br><br>
(ii) You have the right to learn whether your Personal Data is being processed by us, to obtain information about certain aspects of the processing, and to obtain a copy of your Personal Data being processed.
<br><br>
(iii) You have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and request that it be updated or corrected. You also have the right to request us to supplement Personal Data that you believe to be incomplete.
<br><br>
(iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Where Personal Data is processed in the public interest, in the exercise of public authority vested in us, or for the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by raising a ground related to your specific situation to justify the objection. However, you should know that if your Personal Data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may object to such processing at any time without raising a justification. To find out whether we process Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, please refer to the relevant sections of this Policy.
<br><br>
(v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your Personal Data. These circumstances include: the accuracy of your Personal Information is disputed by you and we need to verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information and request instead that its use be restricted; we no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of the processing, but you need it to establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected to the processing pending verification of whether our legitimate grounds outweigh your legitimate grounds. Where processing is restricted, such Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, processed only with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of substantial public interest.
<br><br>
(vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to have your Personal Information erased from us. These circumstances include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw your consent to processing based on consent; you object to processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the Personal Information has been unlawfully processed. However, there are exceptions to the right to erase data, such as when the processing is necessary: to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information; to comply with a legal obligation; or to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
<br><br>
(vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Data provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transferred to another controller without any hindrance on our part, provided that such transfer does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
<br><br>
(viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you have the right to complain to your local data protection authority. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision applies provided that your Personal Data is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract to which you are a party, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
