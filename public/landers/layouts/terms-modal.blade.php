                        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), you have certain data protection rights and we
                        will endeavor to take reasonable steps to enable you to correct, amend, delete or restrict the use of your
                        Personal Data. to limit. If you would like to know what Personal Information we hold about you and if you
                        would like it removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances you have the following
                        data protection rights:<br><br>

                        (i) You have the right to withdraw your consent where you have previously consented to the processing of
                        your Personal Data. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal Data is consent,
                        you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. The revocation does not affect the lawfulness of
                        the processing before the revocation.<br><br>

                        (ii) You have the right to know whether your Personal Data is being processed by us, to obtain information
                        about certain aspects of the processing, and to obtain a copy of your Personal Data being processed.<br><br>

                        (iii) You have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and to request that it be updated or
                        corrected. You also have the right to request that we complete any Personal Data that you believe is
                        incomplete.<br><br>

                        (iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your data if the processing is based on a legal basis
                        other than consent. Where Personal Data is processed in the public interest, in the exercise of an official
                        authority vested in us, or for the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by
                        specific situation-related ground to justify the objection. However, you should know that if your Personal
                        Data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without
                        providing a justification. To find out whether we process Personal Data for direct marketing purposes,
                        please refer to the relevant sections of this Policy.<br><br>

                        (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your Personal Data. These
                        circumstances include: the accuracy of your Personal Data is contested by you and we need to verify its
                        accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal Data and request that its
                        use be restricted instead; we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but you
                        need it to establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected to the processing pending
                        verification whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate grounds. Where processing is
                        restricted, this Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, only
                        processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, for the
                        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or to reasons of great public interest.<br><br>

                        (vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to have your Personal Information deleted from us.
                        These circumstances include: the Personal Data is no longer necessary in connection with the purposes for
                        which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw your consent to consent-based processing; you
                        object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct
                        marketing purposes; and the personal data has been unlawfully processed. However, there are exceptions to
                        the right to erasure, such as when the processing is necessary: for the exercise of the right to freedom of
                        expression and information; to comply with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense
                        of a legal claim.<br><br>

                        (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Data that you have provided to us in a structured,
                        commonly used and machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to have it transferred to another
                        controller without any hindrance on our part, provided that such transfer does not adversely affect the
                        rights and freedoms of others.<br><br>

                        (viii) You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use
                        of your Personal Information. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly to us,
                        you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For more information,
                        please contact your local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision applies provided that your
                        Personal Data is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a
                        contract to which you are a part, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.<br><br>
