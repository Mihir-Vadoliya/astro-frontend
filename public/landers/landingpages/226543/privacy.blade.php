    <h2 style="color: black;">Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We attach great importance to the privacy of its users. To ensure this we have created a policy that is inextricably
    linked to the General Terms and Conditions of the Provider. You acknowledge that the Provider collects
    and processed the Registration Information and information on your use of the Service including the personally
    identifiable information contained therein for the purpose detailed in the Privacy Policy. As a global
    company, the Provider increasingly goes beyond the borders of one country.</p>


    <p>The Service is supplied as is (at the stage of development it happens to be in) and the Provider accepts
    no liability nor does it issue any guarantees or warranty in the event that personal configurations,
    information or messages are not saved, or not saved in due time, or if they are deleted or incorrectly
    delivered. In order to subscribe to the Service, you are required to have access to the Internet and/or
    a mobile communications subscription and pay any service fees associated with such access. You are required
    to pay all expenses incurred in creating such access. You are also responsible for seeing to the connection
    of any necessary equipment, including any mobile telephone or personal computer or whatever devices that
    may be necessary needed and are in working order and suitable for use in connection with the Service.</p>

    <p>
    <strong>General rules</strong>
    <br>
    <br> Regarding the use of the Service you agree to the general rules, rules of play, promotional conditions
    and restrictions established by the Provider. The Provider reserves the right at all times and at its
    own discretion, without being required to issue prior notice, to amend these general rules, rules of
    play, promotional conditions and restrictions. The Provider is entitled to annul accounts that have remained
    inactive for considerable periods of time. You agree with the arrangement whereby the Provider bears
    no responsibility or liability to you in the event that information sent or provided by means of the
    Service is not saved or is deleted in error.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong>
    <br>
    <br> These General Terms and Conditions take the place of all previous agreements between you and the Provider.
    If you use any additional service, material or software from third parties, additional General Terms
    and Conditions may be applicable to you. European law is applicable to the relationship between you and
    the Provider, regardless of any provisions of applicable international law. Disputes will be submitted
    to your national competent court. Any failure by the Provider to exercise or invoke certain rights or
    stipulations laid down in the General Terms and Conditions in no way constitutes a waiver or renunciation
    of those rights or stipulations. If a court of competent jurisdiction is of the opinion that any stipulation
    in the General Terms and Conditions is not applicable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
    must attempt to satisfy the wishes of the parties reflected by that stipulation, while the other stipulations
    of the General Terms and Conditions remain unimpaired.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <strong>SECURITY AND PROTECTION.</strong>
    <br>
    <br> The infrastructure and programmes are constructed and protected in such a way that it can be reasonably
    assumed that unauthorized persons cannot gain access to any information about users. Please refer to
    our General Terms and Conditions regarding liability of the Provider.
    <br>
    <br> Acceptance of this policy means the Provider:
    <br>
    <br> - may use the information or a combination of it to execute the agreement between you and Provider,
    and to allow you the best possible use of the Provider's website;
    <br> - may re-use the information communicated by you on the site or via SMS;
    <br> - can inform you about offers, discounts, new developments and additional services offered by the Provider;
    <br> - may process the information in connection with the formation or maintenance of a direct relationship
    between the Provider and/or enterprises selected by it and you for the purpose of recruitment for commercial
    or charity. The Provider may anonymize that information and use it or offer it to third parties in anonymous
    form.
    <br>
    <br> Your acceptance of this policy
    <br>
